There are two use cases of 'self' keyword in ruby:

1) One is for class methods like.
    [ruby]
        def self.start
        end
    [end]

2) self also refers to current instace(object) of class.
    we can call all instance methodes or attributes of current obj through self.

    if we call attribute in class through self.attribute_name, then it is actually calling methode(getter)
    without self it assessing directly
