Inject/reduce:
  both are same

  # prgram to find even numver with inject
  arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,20,45]
  result = []

  arr.inject(result) do |result , element|
      result.push element if (element % 2) == 0
      result
  end

  puts result

  !note: here result is passed as by reference not by vale.
